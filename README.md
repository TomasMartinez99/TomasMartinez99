### Hi there, i'm Tomas Martinez ðŸ‘‹

During the last 3 years I have worked as Community manager for different SMEs and companies in my region, also this last year I have developed websites for companies in different areas as I also participate in web development projects. Currently I am about to graduate as a Technical Analyst and Systems Developer.

I consider myself a proactive, flexible, responsible and eager to learn person. At the same time, I like to work in a team contributing ideas and solutions to achieve a goal.
